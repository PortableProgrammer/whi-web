        <p class="well">
            Switcher is based on <a href="http://insentient.net" target="_blank">Switcher 2.0</a> by Bao Nguyen, last updated in late 2007. We've been using it around here since then, and we love it. No other application on the market comes as close to a pure Expos&eacute; experience with a minimum of fluff.
        </p>
        <div class="page-header">
            <h2>History</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            The original is a wonderful product, and works very well, but it has a few issues. After two years' worth of repeated attempts at submitting bug reports, feature requests, and just generally trying to get Bao to return our messages, we decided to fix the app ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            The end result is forked from Bao's 2.0 release and represents, in our opinion, an almost perfect implementation of Expos&eacute; on Windows.
        </p>
        <div class="page-header">
            <h2>Moral Issues <small>(or, How we learned to stop worrying and consider it abandonware)</small></h2>
        </div>
        <p>
            We debated long and hard about releasing this to the wild, since it is not in any way endorsed or authorized by Bao, but it's been
            <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2007);</script> years since the last update and at least
            <script>                document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2009);</script> years since we started updating it ourselves, so we feel like it's essentially abandonware. Our major argument against it internally has been that, as of late 2013, insentient.net is still up and running, even though email goes unanswered and the blog link is dead, so
            <em>someone</em> must be paying that bill, and whomever it is probably is in contact with Bao, meaning there's still the
            <em>chance</em> that it's not abandoned. Regardless, Bao, if you're around,
            <a href="mailto:support@warnerheavyindustries.com">drop us a line</a> and we'll be happy to discuss the project. We'd love to merge our edits with yours and produce what we feel is a killer app.

            If you get an error stating
            <strong>"Warning: Aero is disabled"</strong>, you need to enable Aero for Switcher to work. Windows XP and earlier doesn't support Aero; Windows Vista or later is required. Furthermore, Aero is not available on Windows Vista Home Basic or Windows 7 Starter.
            <br />
            If you have a supported Windows Vista or 7 version, choose "Windows Aero" from the list of available color schemes in the control panel:
            <ol>
                <li>Open the Control Panel</li>
                <li>Underneath "Appearance and Personalization", select "Change the color scheme"</li>
                <li>Choose "Windows Aero" and click "OK"</li>
            </ol>
            For Windows 8 and later, Aero is automatically enabled if your hardware supports it.

                        Switcher relies on global mouse and keyboard hooks to detect its triggers. By design, these hooks run in the current user context. If you have UAC enabled, this means that your current user context is a normal user, which cannot access the administrative session. This results in Switcher not receiving trigger events if the currently-active application is run as an administrator. This can be mitigated by running Switcher as an administrator all the time, but that requires responding to the UAC prompt upon every launch, which, to us, is infinitely annoying.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We could also resolve the issue by signing our code with a code-signing certificate, but we can't currently justify the cost associated with the code-signing certificate for a freeware product.

                                <li class="list-group-item">2. Open Notepad (normal app) and Computer Mangement (elevated, requiring UAC prompt)</li>

                        If Switcher is restarted as an elevated user ("run as administrator"), it behaves as expected, since it has access to the administrative session, which also has access to the non-admin session.
